❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` relies on global variables `a` and `b`. This makes the function's behavior unpredictable and hard
to reason about, as the values of `a` and `b` could change from anywhere in the code.
* ❌ There are no input parameters defined for the `sum` function, making it inflexible and limited to only summing the
globally defined variables `a` and `b`.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function `sum` now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it more explicit and self-contained.
* ✔ The function's behavior is now predictable and only depends on the input arguments.
* ✔ The function can now be used to sum any two numbers, making it more versatile and reusable.
